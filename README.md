**Credit Card Default Prediction**
Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to predict credit card default risk using customer demographic data, credit information, and historical payment behavior. The objective is to identify customers likely to default in the following month so that financial institutions can proactively manage credit risk.

The dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains real credit card client data from Taiwan.
